      <description>Removing of empty parts is a new feature introduced in 20.12.
Earlier versions leave empty parts (with 0 rows) if TTL removes all rows from a part (https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5491).
If you set up TTL for your data it is likely that there are quite many empty parts in your system.
The new version notices empty parts and tries to remove all of them immediately.
This is a one-time operation which runs right after an upgrade.</description>
