All queries and datasets are unique, so in different situations different hacks could work better or worse.

### PreFilter values before GROUP BY

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    sum(clicks)
FROM sessions
WHERE created_at > '2021-11-01 00:00:00'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING (argMax(clicks, created_at) = 16) AND (argMax(platform, created_at) = 'Rat')
FORMAT `Null`


<Debug> MemoryTracker: Peak memory usage (for query): 18.36 GiB.

SELECT
    user_id,
    sum(clicks)
FROM sessions
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT user_id
    FROM sessions
    WHERE (platform = 'Rat') AND (clicks = 16) AND (created_at > '2021-11-01 00:00:00') -- So we will select user_id which could potentially match our HAVING clause in OUTER query.
) AND (created_at > '2021-11-01 00:00:00')
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING (argMax(clicks, created_at) = 16) AND (argMax(platform, created_at) = 'Rat')
FORMAT `Null`

<Debug> MemoryTracker: Peak memory usage (for query): 4.43 GiB.
```


### Use Fixed-width data types instead of String 

For example, you have 2 strings which has values in special form like this

'ABX 1412312312313' 

You can just remove the first 4 characters and convert the rest to UInt64

toUInt64(substr('ABX 1412312312313',5))

And you packed 17 bytes in 8, more than 2 times the improvement of size!

It can be especially useful when you tries to do GROUP BY lc_column_1, lc_column_2 and ClickHouse® falls back to serialized algorithm.

### Split your query in multiple smaller queries and execute them one BY one

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    sum(clicks)

GROUP BY
    user_id,
    platform
FORMAT `Null`

SELECT
    user_id,
    sum(clicks)
FROM sessions
WHERE (cityHash64(user_id) % 4) = 0
GROUP BY
    user_id,
    platform
FORMAT `Null`

MemoryTracker: Peak memory usage (for query): 8.16 GiB.

Elapsed: 2.910 sec. Processed 1.00 billion rows, 27.00 GB (343.64 million rows/s., 9.28 GB/s.)


```
### Shard your data by one of common high cardinal GROUP BY key

So on each shard you will have 1/N of all unique combination and this will result in smaller hash tables.

Let's create 2 distributed tables with different distribution: rand() and by user_id

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions_distributed AS sessions
ENGINE = Distributed('distr-groupby', default, sessions, rand());

INSERT INTO sessions_distributed WITH
    CAST(number % 4, 'Enum8(\'Orange\' = 0, \'Melon\' = 1, \'Red\' = 2, \'Blue\' = 3)') AS app,
    concat('UID: ', leftPad(toString(number % 20000000), 8, '0')) AS user_id,
    toDateTime('2021-10-01 10:11:12') + (number / 300) AS created_at,
    CAST((number + 14) % 3, 'Enum8(\'Bat\' = 0, \'Mice\' = 1, \'Rat\' = 2)') AS platform,
    number % 17 AS clicks,
    generateUUIDv4() AS session_id
SELECT
    app,
    user_id,
    created_at,
    platform,
    clicks,
    session_id
FROM numbers_mt(1000000000);

CREATE TABLE sessions_2 ON CLUSTER 'distr-groupby'
(
    `app` LowCardinality(String),
    `user_id` String,
    `created_at` DateTime,
    `platform` LowCardinality(String),
    `clicks` UInt32,
    `session_id` UUID
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(created_at)
ORDER BY (app, user_id, session_id, created_at);

CREATE TABLE sessions_distributed_2 AS sessions
ENGINE = Distributed('distr-groupby', default, sessions_2, cityHash64(user_id));

INSERT INTO sessions_distributed_2 WITH
    CAST(number % 4, 'Enum8(\'Orange\' = 0, \'Melon\' = 1, \'Red\' = 2, \'Blue\' = 3)') AS app,
    concat('UID: ', leftPad(toString(number % 20000000), 8, '0')) AS user_id,
    toDateTime('2021-10-01 10:11:12') + (number / 300) AS created_at,
    CAST((number + 14) % 3, 'Enum8(\'Bat\' = 0, \'Mice\' = 1, \'Rat\' = 2)') AS platform,
    number % 17 AS clicks,
    generateUUIDv4() AS session_id

### Reduce number of threads

Because each thread uses an independent hash table, if you lower thread amount it will reduce number of hash tables as well and lower memory usage at the cost of slower query execution.

    user_id,
    sum(clicks)

### Play with two-level

Disable:

```sql
SET group_by_two_level_threshold = 0, group_by_two_level_threshold_bytes = 0; 
```

From 22.4 ClickHouse can predict, when it make sense to initialize aggregation with two-level from start, instead of rehashing on fly.
It can improve query time.

### GROUP BY in external memory

Slow!

### Use hash function for GROUP BY keys

GROUP BY cityHash64('xxxx')

Can lead to incorrect results as hash functions is not 1 to 1 mapping.
