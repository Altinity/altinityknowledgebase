`SELECT * FROM table FINAL`

### History

* Before ClickHouse® 20.5 - always executed in a single thread and slow.
* Since 20.5  - final can be parallel, see [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/10463)
* Since 20.10 - you can use `do_not_merge_across_partitions_select_final` setting.
* Since 22.6  - final even more parallel, see [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36396](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/36396)
* Since 22.8  - final doesn't read excessive data, see [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47801](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/47801)
* Since 23.5  - final use less memory, see [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50429](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/50429)
* Since 23.9  - final doesn't read PK columns if unneeded ie only one part in partition, see [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/53919](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/53919)
* Since 23.12 - final applied only for intersecting ranges of parts, see [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58120](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58120)
* Since 24.1  - final doesn't compare rows from the same part with level > 0, see [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58142](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58142)
* Since 24.1  - final use vertical algorithm, (more cache friendly), see [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54366](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/54366)
  
See [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/15938) and [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11722](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/11722)

### Partitioning

Right partition design could speed up FINAL processing.

Example:
1. Daily partitioning
2. After day end + some time interval during which you can get some updates - for example at 3am / 6am you do `OPTIMIZE TABLE xxx PARTITION 'prev_day' FINAL`
3. In that case using that FINAL with `do_not_merge_across_partitions_select_final` will be cheap.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS repl_tbl;

CREATE TABLE repl_tbl
(
    `key` UInt32,
    `val_1` UInt32,
    `val_2` String,
    `val_3` String,
    `val_4` String,
    `val_5` UUID,
    `ts` DateTime
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(ts)
PARTITION BY toDate(ts)
ORDER BY key;

​
INSERT INTO repl_tbl SELECT number as key, rand() as val_1, randomStringUTF8(10) as val_2, randomStringUTF8(5) as val_3, randomStringUTF8(4) as val_4, generateUUIDv4() as val_5, '2020-01-01 00:00:00' as ts FROM numbers(10000000);
OPTIMIZE TABLE repl_tbl PARTITION ID '20200101' FINAL;
INSERT INTO repl_tbl SELECT number as key, rand() as val_1, randomStringUTF8(10) as val_2, randomStringUTF8(5) as val_3, randomStringUTF8(4) as val_4, generateUUIDv4() as val_5, '2020-01-02 00:00:00' as ts FROM numbers(10000000);
OPTIMIZE TABLE repl_tbl PARTITION ID '20200102' FINAL;
INSERT INTO repl_tbl SELECT number as key, rand() as val_1, randomStringUTF8(10) as val_2, randomStringUTF8(5) as val_3, randomStringUTF8(4) as val_4, generateUUIDv4() as val_5, '2020-01-03 00:00:00' as ts FROM numbers(10000000);
OPTIMIZE TABLE repl_tbl PARTITION ID '20200103' FINAL;
INSERT INTO repl_tbl SELECT number as key, rand() as val_1, randomStringUTF8(10) as val_2, randomStringUTF8(5) as val_3, randomStringUTF8(4) as val_4, generateUUIDv4() as val_5, '2020-01-04 00:00:00' as ts FROM numbers(10000000);
OPTIMIZE TABLE repl_tbl PARTITION ID '20200104' FINAL;

SYSTEM STOP MERGES repl_tbl;
INSERT INTO repl_tbl SELECT number as key, rand() as val_1, randomStringUTF8(10) as val_2, randomStringUTF8(5) as val_3, randomStringUTF8(4) as val_4, generateUUIDv4() as val_5, '2020-01-05 00:00:00' as ts FROM numbers(10000000);

/* only 0.35 sec slower, and while partitions have about the same size that extra cost will be about constant */

```

### Light ORDER BY 

All columns specified in ORDER BY will be read during FINAL processing.  Use fewer columns and lighter column types to create faster queries.

Example: UUID vs UInt64
```
CREATE TABLE uuid_table (id UUID, value UInt64)    ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree() ORDER BY id;
CREATE TABLE uint64_table (id UInt64,value UInt64) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree() ORDER BY id;

INSERT INTO uuid_table SELECT generateUUIDv4(), number FROM numbers(5E7);
INSERT INTO uint64_table SELECT number, number         FROM numbers(5E7);

SELECT sum(value) FROM uuid_table   FINAL format JSON;
SELECT sum(value) FROM uint64_table FINAL format JSON;
```
