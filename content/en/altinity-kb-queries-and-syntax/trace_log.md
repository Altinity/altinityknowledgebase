## Collecting query execution flamegraph using system.trace_log

ClickHouseÂ® has embedded functionality to analyze the details of query performance.

It's `system.trace_log` table.

By default it collects information only about queries when runs longer than 1 sec (and collects stacktraces every second).

You can adjust that per query using settings `query_profiler_real_time_period_ns` & `query_profiler_cpu_time_period_ns`.

Both works very similar (with desired interval dump the stacktraces of all the threads which execute the query).
real timer - allows to 'see' the situations when cpu was not working much, but time was spend for example on IO.
cpu timer - allows to see the 'hot' points in calculations more accurately (skip the io time).

Trying to collect stacktraces with a frequency higher than few KHz is usually not possible. 

To check where most of the RAM is used you can collect stacktraces during memory allocations / deallocation, by using the
setting `memory_profiler_sample_probability`.


### clickhouse-speedscope

```bash 
# install 
wget https://github.com/laplab/clickhouse-speedscope/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz -O clickhouse-speedscope.tar.gz
tar -xvzf clickhouse-speedscope.tar.gz
cd clickhouse-speedscope-master/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For debugging particular query:
```
clickhouse-client 

SET query_profiler_cpu_time_period_ns=1000000; -- 1000 times per 'cpu' sec
-- or SET query_profiler_real_time_period_ns=2000000; -- 500 times per 'real' sec.
-- or SET memory_profiler_sample_probability=0.1; -- to debug the memory allocations

SELECT ... <your select>

SYSTEM FLUSH LOGS;

-- get the query_id from the clickhouse-client output or from system.query_log (also pay attention on query_id vs initial_query_id for distributed queries).
```

Now let's process that: 
```
python3 main.py &  # start the proxy in background
python3 main.py --query-id 908952ee-71a8-48a4-84d5-f4db92d45a5d # process the stacktraces
fg # get the proxy from background 
Ctrl + C  # stop it.
```
