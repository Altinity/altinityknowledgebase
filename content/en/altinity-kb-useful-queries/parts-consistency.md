## Check if there are blocks missing
```sql
SELECT
    database,
    table,
    partition_id,
    ranges.1 AS previous_part,
    ranges.2 AS next_part,
    ranges.3 AS previous_block_number,

        arrayPopBack(groupArray(max_block_number) AS max) AS max_adj,
        arrayFilter((x, y, z) -> (y != (z + 1)), arrayZip(arrayPopBack(groupArray(name) AS name_arr), arrayPopFront(name_arr), max_adj, min_adj), min_adj, max_adj) AS missing_ranges

## Find the number of blocks in a table
```sql
SELECT
    database,
    table,
    partition_id,
    sum(max_block_number - min_block_number) AS blocks_count
FROM system.parts
WHERE active AND (table = 'query_thread_log') AND (partition_id = '202108') AND active
GROUP BY
    database,
    table,
    partition_id

## Compare the list of parts in ZooKeeper with the list of parts on disk
```sql
select zoo.p_path as part_zoo, zoo.ctime, zoo.mtime, disk.p_path as part_disk
from
(
  select concat(path,'/',name) as p_path, ctime, mtime
  from system.zookeeper where path in (select concat(replica_path,'/parts') from system.replicas)
) zoo
left join 
(
  select concat(replica_path,'/parts/',name) as p_path
  from system.parts inner join system.replicas using (database, table)
) disk on zoo.p_path = disk.p_path
where part_disk='' and zoo.mtime <= now() - interval 1 hour
order by part_zoo;
```

You can clean that orphan zk records (need to execute using `delete` in zkCli, `rm` in zk-shell):
```sql
select 'delete '||part_zoo
from (
select zoo.p_path as part_zoo, zoo.ctime, zoo.mtime, disk.p_path as part_disk
from
(
  select concat(path,'/',name) as p_path, ctime, mtime
  from system.zookeeper where path in (select concat(replica_path,'/parts') from system.replicas)
) zoo
left join 
(
  select concat(replica_path,'/parts/',name) as p_path
  from system.parts inner join system.replicas using (database, table)
) disk on zoo.p_path = disk.p_path
where part_disk='' and zoo.mtime <= now() - interval 1 day
order by part_zoo) format TSVRaw;
```
