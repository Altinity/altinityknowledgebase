    any(query),
    count(),

## Find queries which were started but not finished at some moment in time

```sql
SELECT
  query_id,
  min(event_time) t,
  any(query)
FROM system.query_log
where event_date = today() and event_time > '2021-11-25 02:29:12'
GROUP BY query_id
HAVING countIf(type='QueryFinish') = 0 OR sum(query_duration_ms) > 100000
order by t;

select
     query_id,

from system.query_log
where event_time between '2021-09-24 07:00:00' and '2021-09-24 09:00:00'
group by query_id HAVING countIf(type=1) <> countIf(type!=1)
