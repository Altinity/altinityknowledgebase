| Codec Name       | Recommended Data Types               | Performance Notes                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LZ4              | Any                                  | Used by default. Extremely fast; good compression; balanced speed and efficiency                                                                                                                   |
| ZSTD(level)      | Any                                  | Good compression; pretty fast; best for high compression needs. Don't use levels higher than 3.                                                                                                    |
| LZ4HC(level)     | Any                                  | LZ4 High Compression algorithm with configurable level; slower but better compression than LZ4, but decompression is still fast.                                                                   |
| Delta            | Integer Types, Time Series Data, Timestamps      | Preprocessor (should be followed by some compression codec). Stores difference between neighboring values; good for monotonically increasing data.                                                 |
| DoubleDelta      | Integer Types, Time Series Data      | Stores difference between neighboring delta values; suitable for time series data                                                                                                                  |
| Gorilla          | Floating Point Types                 | Calculates XOR between current and previous value; suitable for slowly changing numbers                                                                                                            |
| T64              | Integer, Time Series Data, Timestamps        | Preprocessor (should be followed by some compression codec). Crops unused high bits; puts them into a 64x64 bit matrix; optimized for 64-bit data types                                            |
| GCD              | Integer Numbers                      | Preprocessor (should be followed by some compression codec). Greatest common divisor compression; divides values by a common divisor; effective for divisible integer sequences                    |
| FPC              | Floating Point Numbers               | Designed for Float64; Algorithm detailed in [FPC paper](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/papers/dcc07a.pdf), [ClickHouse® PR #37553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/37553) |
| ZSTD_QAT         | Any                                  | Requires hardware support for QuickAssist Technology (QAT) hardware; provides accelerated compression tasks                                                                                        |
| DEFLATE_QPL      | Any                                  | Requires hardware support for Intel’s QuickAssist Technology for DEFLATE compression; enhanced performance for specific hardware                                                                   |
| LowCardinality   | String                               | It's not a codec, but a datatype modifier. Reduces representation size; effective for columns with low cardinality                                                                                 |
| NONE             | Non-compressable data with very high entropy, like some random string, or some AggregateFunction states              | No compression at all. Can be used on the columns that can not be compressed anyway.                                                                                                               |
