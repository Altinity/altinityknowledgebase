     How to create ORDER BY suitable for filtering over two different columns in two different queries
---

Suppose we have telecom CDR data in which A party calls B party. Each data row consists of A party details: event_timestamp, A MSISDN , A IMEI, A IMSI , A start location, A end location , B MSISDN, B IMEI, B IMSI , B start location, B end location, and some other metadata.
 
Searches will use one of the A or B fields, for example, A IMSI, within the start and end time window.

A msisdn, A imsi, A imei values are tightly coupled as users rarely change their phones.
 

The queries will be:

```sql
select * from X where A = '0123456789' and ts between ...;
select * from X where B = '0123456789' and ts between ...;
```

and both A & B are high-cardinality values

ClickHouseÂ® primary skip index (ORDER BY/PRIMARY KEY) works great when you always include leading ORDER BY columns in the WHERE filter.  There are exceptions for low-cardinality columns and high-correlated values, but here is another case.  A & B both have high cardinality, and it seems that their correlation is at a medium level.

Various solutions exist, and their effectiveness largely depends on the correlation of different column data. Testing all solutions on actual data is necessary to select the best one.


### ORDER BY + additional Skip Index

```sql
create table X (
    A UInt32,
    B UInt32,
    ts DateTime,
    ....
    INDEX ix_B (B) type minmax GRANULARITY 3
) engine = MergeTree
partition by toYYYYMM(ts)
order by (toStartOfDay(ts),A,B);
```

bloom_filter index type instead of min_max could work fine in some situations.

### Inverted index as a projection

```sql
create table X (
    A UInt32,
    B UInt32,
    ts DateTime,
    ....
    PROJECTION ix_B  (
        select A, B,ts ORDER BY B, ts
    )
) engine = MergeTree
partition by toYYYYMM(ts)
order by (toStartOfDay(ts),A,B);

select * from X 
where A in (select A from X where B='....' and ts between ...)
  and B='...' and ts between ... ;
```

- The number of rows the subquery returns should not be very high. 1M rows seems to be a suitable limit.
- A separate table with a Materialized View can also be used similarly.
- accessing pattern for the main table will "point", so better to lower index_granularity to 256.  That will increase RAM usage by Primary Key


### mortonEncode 
(available from 23.10) 

Do not prioritize either A or B, but distribute indexing efficiency between them.

```sql
create table X (
    A UInt32,
    B UInt32,
    ts DateTime,
    ....
) engine = MergeTree
partition by toYYYYMM(ts)
order by (toStartOfDay(ts),mortonEncode(A,B));
select * from X where A = '0123456789' and ts between ...;
select * from X where B = '0123456789' and ts between ...;
```

###  mortonEncode with non-UInt columns
   
[mortonEncode](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/encoding-functions#mortonencode) function requires UInt columns, but sometimes different column types are needed (like String or ipv6).  In such a case, the cityHash64() function can be used both for inserting and querying:

```sql
create table X (
    A IPv6,
    B IPv6,
    AA alias cityHash64(A),
    BB alias cityHash64(B),
    ts DateTime materialized now()
) engine = MergeTree
partition by toYYYYMM(ts)
order by 
(toStartOfDay(ts),mortonEncode(cityHash64(A),cityHash64(B)))
;

insert into X values ('fd7a:115c:a1e0:ab12:4843:cd96:624c:9a17','fd7a:115c:a1e0:ab12:4843:cd96:624c:9a17')

select * from X where cityHash64(toIPv6('fd7a:115c:a1e0:ab12:4843:cd96:624c:9a17')) =  AA;
```

###  hilbertEncode as alternative 
(available from 24.6)

[hilbertEncode](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/encoding-functions#hilbertencode) can be used instead of mortonEncode. On some data it allows better results than mortonEncode.
