### `migrate`

`migrate` is a simple schema migration tool written in golang. No external dependencies are required (like interpreter, jre), only one platform-specific executable. [golang-migrate/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)

`migrate` supports several databases, including ClickHouse (support was introduced by [@kshvakov](https://github.com/kshvakov)).

To store information about migrations state `migrate` creates one additional table in target database, by default that table is called `schema_migrations`.

#### Install

[download](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases) the `migrate` executable for your platform and put it to the folder listed in your %PATH.

```bash
#wget https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases/download/v3.2.0/migrate.linux-amd64.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases/download/v4.14.1/migrate.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf migrate.linux-amd64.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/bin
mv migrate.linux-amd64 ~/bin/migrate
rm migrate.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

#### Sample usage

```bash
mkdir migrations
echo 'create table test(id UInt8) Engine = Memory;' > migrations/000001_my_database_init.up.sql
echo 'DROP TABLE test;' > migrations/000001_my_database_init.down.sql

# you can also auto-create file with new migrations with automatic numbering like that:
migrate create -dir migrations -seq -digits 6 -ext sql my_database_init

edit migrations/000001_my_database_init.up.sql & migrations/000001_my_database_init.down.sql

migrate -database 'clickhouse://localhost:9000' -path ./migrations up
1/u my_database_init (6.502974ms)

migrate -database 'clickhouse://localhost:9000' -path ./migrations down
1/d my_database_init (2.164394ms)

# clears the database (use carefully - will not ask any confirmations)
âžœ migrate -database 'clickhouse://localhost:9000' -path ./migrations drop
```

#### Connection string format

`clickhouse://host:port?username=user&password=qwerty&database=clicks`

| URL Query | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x-migrations-table`| Name of the migrations table |
| `x-migrations-table-engine`| Engine to use for the migrations table, defaults to TinyLog |
| `x-cluster-name` | Name of cluster for creating table cluster wide |
| `database` | The name of the database to connect to |
| `username` | The user to sign in as |
| `password` | The user's password |
| `host` | The host to connect to. |
| `port` | The port to bind to. |
| `secure` | to use a secure connection (for self-signed also add `skip_verify=1`) |

#### Replicated / Distributed / Cluster environments

`golang-migrate` supports a clustered Clickhouse environment since v4.15.0.

If you provide `x-cluster-name` query param, it will create the table to store migration data on the passed cluster.

#### Known issues

`could not load time location: unknown time zone Europe/Moscow in line 0:`

It's happens due of missing tzdata package in migrate/migrate docker image of golang-migrate.
There is 2 possible solutions:

1. You can build your own golang-migrate image from official with tzdata package.
2. If you using it as part of your CI you can add installing tzdata package as one of step in CI before using golang-migrate.

Using database name in `x-migrations-table`

1. Creates table with `database.table`
2. When running migrations migrate actually uses database from query settings and encapsulate `database.table` as table name: ``other_database.`database.table```
