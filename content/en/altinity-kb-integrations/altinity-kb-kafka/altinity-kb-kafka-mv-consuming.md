    How Multiple MVs attached to Kafka table consume and how they are affected by kafka_num_consumers/kafka_thread_per_consumer
---



So the basic pipeline depicted is a Kafka table with 2 MVs attached. The Kafka broker has 2 topics and 4 partitions. 

### kafka_thread_per_consumer = 0

Kafka engine table will act as 2 consumers but only 1 thread for both consumers. For this scenario we use these settings:

```
kafka_num_consumers = 2
kafka_thread_per_consumer = 0
```

The same Kafka engine will create 2 streams, 1 for each consumer and will join them in a union stream. And it will use 1 thread `[ 2385 ]`
This is how we can see it in the logs:

```log
2022.11.09 17:49:34.282077 [ 2385 ] {} <Debug> StorageKafka (kafka_table): Started streaming to 2 attached views
```

* How ClickHouseÂ® calculates the number of threads depending on the `thread_per_consumer` setting:

  ```c++
    auto stream_count = thread_per_consumer ? 1 : num_created_consumers;
        sources.reserve(stream_count);
        pipes.reserve(stream_count);
        for (size_t i = 0; i < stream_count; ++i)
        {
           ......
        }
  ```

Also a detailed graph of the pipeline:

![thread_per_consumer0](/assets/thread_per_consumer0.png)

With this approach if the number of consumers are increased, still Kafka engine will use only 1 thread to flush. The consuming/processing rate will probably be increased but not linearly, for example 5 consumers will not consume 5 times faster. Also a good property of this approach is the `linearization` of INSERTS, which means that the order of the inserts is preserved and it is sequential. This option is good for small/medium kafka topics.


### kafka_thread_per_consumer = 1

Kafka engine table will act as 2 consumers and 1 thread per consumers For this scenario we use these settings:

```
kafka_num_consumers = 2
kafka_thread_per_consumer = 1
```

Here the pipeline works like this:

![thread_per_consumer1](/assets/thread_per_consumer1.png)


With this approach the number of consumers are increased and each consumer will use a thread and so the consuming/processing rate. In this scenario it is important to remark that topic needs to have as many partitions as consumers (threads) to achieve the maximum performance. Also if the number of consumers(threads) needs to be raised to more than 16 you need to change the background pool of threads setting `background_message_broker_schedule_pool_size` to a higher value than 16 (which is the default). This option is good for large kafka topics with millions of messages per second.
