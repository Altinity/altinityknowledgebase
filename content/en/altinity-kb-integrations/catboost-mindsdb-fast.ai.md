CatBoost:

* It uses gradient boosting - a hard to use technique which can outperform neural networks. Gradient boosting is powerful but it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot using it.
* The documentation on how to use it is quite lacking. The only good source of information on how to properly configure a model to yield good results is this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usdEWSDisS0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usdEWSDisS0) . We had to dig around GitHub issues to find out how to make it work with ClickHouse®.
* CatBoost is fast. Other libraries will take ~5X to ~10X as long to do what CatBoost does.
* CatBoost will do preprocessing out of the box (fills nulls, apply standard scaling, encodes strings as numbers).
* CatBoost has all functions you'd need (metrics, plotters, feature importance)

It makes sense to split what CatBoost does into 2 parts:

* preprocessing (fills nulls, apply standard scaling, encodes strings as numbers)
* number crunching (convert preprocessed numbers to another number - ex: revenue of impression)

Compared to [Fast.ai](http://fast.ai/), CatBoost pre-processing is as simple to use and produces results that can be as good as [Fast.ai](http://fast.ai/).

The number crunching part of [Fast.ai](http://fast.ai/) is no-config. For CatBoost you need to configure it, a lot.

CatBoost won't simplify or hide any complexity of the process. So you need to know data science terms and what it does (ex: if your model is underfitting you can use a smaller l2_reg parameter in the model constructor).

In the end both [Fast.ai](http://fast.ai/) and CatBoost can yield comparable results.

Regarding deploying models, CatBoost is really good. The model runs fast, it has a simple binary format which can be loaded in ClickHouse, C, or Python and it will encapsulate pre-processing with the binary file. Deploying [Fast.ai](http://fast.ai/) models at scale/speed is impossible out of the box (we have our custom solution to do it which is not simple).

TLDR: CatBoost is fast, produces awesome models, is super easy to deploy and it's easy to use/train (after becoming familiar with it despite the bad documentation & if you know data science terms).

## Regarding MindsDB

The project seems to be a good idea but it's too young. I was using the GUI version and I've encountered some bugs, and none of those bugs have a good error message.

* It won't show data in preview.
* The "download" button won't work.
* It's trying to create and drop tables in ClickHouse without me asking it to.
* Other than bugs:
  * It will only use 1 core to do everything (training, analysis, download).
  * Analysis will only run with a very small subset of data, if I use something like 1M rows it never finishes.
* Training a model on 100k rows took 25 minutes - (CatBoost takes 90s to train with 1M rows)
* The model trained on MindsDB is way worse. It had r-squared of 0.46 (CatBoost=0.58)

  To me it seems that they are a plugin which connects ClickHouse to MySQL to run the model in Pytorch.

  It's too complex and hard to debug and understand. The resulting model is not good enough.

  TLDR: Easy to use (if bugs are ignored), too slow to train & produces a bad model.
